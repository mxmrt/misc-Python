# misc-Python

Miscellaneous works in Python to keep me sharp. This repository contains:

1. **Censor.py:**
        I recently took a web course through [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) to brush 
        up on my Python skills. There was one exercise that asked the user to 
        create a function that would take two strings: the first is a text 
        string, and second is a text string of a word to be censored out with 
        asterisks. However, I thought I would take the exercise a bit further 
        replace parts of words that matched the word to be censored. This is 
        somewhat similar to the "replace" method.

# misc-Python

Miscellaneous works in Python to keep me sharp. This repository contains:

1. **Censor.py:**
        I recently took a web course through [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) to brush 
        up on my Python skills. There was one exercise that asked the user to 
        create a function that would take two strings: the first is a text 
        string, and second is a text string of a word to be censored out with 
        asterisks. However, I thought I would take the exercise a bit further 
        replace parts of words that matched the word to be censored. This is 
        somewhat similar to the "replace" method. 
2.  **project euler 1-10.py:**
        Code for a few exercises from Project Euler. *[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.*
